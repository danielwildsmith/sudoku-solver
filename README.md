# Sudoku Solver
## About
Sudoku Solver allows you to play sudoku like normal, but if you get stuck, 
you can watch a recursive solve method that uses backtracking complete the board for you!

This project was a great way of learning a more advanced algorithm, and visualizing
it through a GUI really deepened my conceptual understanding. Overall, this was a fascinating project!

## How to Play
1. Download the files and maintain file structure. Run gui.py.
2. Use the arrow keys to move between tiles. Type in numbers 1-9, and press enter to confirm.
3. If you ever get stuck or want to see the backtracking visualization, press space!
